# Plain Text Email Formatting Standards

This document outlines the standards for formatting plain text emails to ensure clarity, professionalism, and compliance with anti-spam guidelines.

## 1. Subject Lines

*   **Clear and Relevant:** Subject lines should accurately reflect the email's content.
*   **Non-Spammy:** Avoid using misleading or overly sensational language. Do not use excessive punctuation (e.g. "!!!") or capitalization.

## 2. Overall Structure

*   **Concise and Focused:** Emails should be brief and to the point, addressing a single topic or a closely related set of topics.

## 3. Salutation

*   **Personalized:** Whenever possible, personalize the salutation (e.g., "Hi [FirstName],"). If the first name is unavailable, use a generic but polite greeting (e.g., "Hi there,").

## 4. Body Content

*   **Short Paragraphs:** Use short paragraphs, typically 1-3 sentences long, to improve readability.
*   **Simple, Direct Language:** Employ clear and straightforward language. Avoid jargon or overly complex sentences.
*   **Clear Value Proposition:** Clearly communicate the benefit or purpose of the email to the recipient.
*   **Avoid Excessive Capitalization:** Do not use all caps (e.g., "NO ALL CAPS"). Use capitalization only for standard grammatical purposes (e.g., start of sentences, proper nouns).
*   **Strictly Plain Text:** Emails must be in plain text format only. Do not include any HTML elements (e.g., `<b>`, `<img>`, `<a>` with display text different from URL). Markdown should not be used with the expectation that it will be rendered as formatted text in the email body; use plain text conventions instead (e.g., asterisks for emphasis if necessary, but sparingly).

## 5. Links

*   **Use Full URLs:** Display the full URL for links (e.g., `https://www.example.com/calendly-link`). Avoid link shorteners where possible, as they can sometimes be flagged by spam filters.
*   **Sparingly Use Multiple Links:** If multiple links are necessary, ensure they are all relevant and avoid overwhelming the recipient.

## 6. Call to Action (CTA)

*   **Clear and Understandable:** The desired action from the recipient should be obvious and easy to follow. For example: "Schedule a call here: [Full Calendly Link]" or "Read more about the topic here: [Full URL]".

## 7. Closing

*   **Professional:** Use a professional closing (e.g., "Best regards,", "Thanks,", "Sincerely,").

## 8. Signature

*   **Minimal:** Keep the signature brief. Include the sender's name and optionally their title and company. Avoid images or extensive contact information.
    *   Example:
        ```
        Best regards,

        [Sender Name]
        [Sender Title (Optional)]
        [Company Name (Optional)]
        ```

## 9. Unsubscribe Footer

*   **Mandatory Inclusion:** Always include an unsubscribe option. The standard text is: "Reply STOP to unsubscribe".
*   **Positioning:** Place the unsubscribe footer at the very end of the email.
*   **Clarity:** Ensure a blank line separates the unsubscribe footer from the signature. This helps in clearly distinguishing it from the email content.

    *   Example:
        ```
        [Signature]

        Reply STOP to unsubscribe
        ```

## 10. Tone

*   **Human, Professional, and Helpful:** Maintain a respectful, professional, and helpful tone. The email should sound like it's from a person, not a robot.
*   **Avoid Aggressive Language:** Do not use overly aggressive, demanding, or high-pressure sales tactics.

## 11. Consistency

*   **Uniform Application:** Apply these standards consistently across all automated and manually sent plain text emails. This helps in maintaining brand consistency and recipient expectations.
